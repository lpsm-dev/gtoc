# Prompt for CLI Development in Go using Cobra

## Context
I'm developing a CLI (Command Line Interface) in Go using the Cobra library. I need help to implement a robust and well-structured command line application.

## Experience
I have significant experience with:
- Development in Go (Golang)
- Cobra library for structuring CLI commands
- Command line interface design principles
- Implementation of flags, arguments and subcommands
- Error handling and validation of user input

## Needs
I need specific guidance to:
1. structuring the project following best practices
2. Implement commands, subcommands and flags efficiently
3. Creating automatic help documentation
4. Manage configurations and persistence
5. Implement elegant input validations and error handling

## Code Examples
If possible, include code examples for:
- Basic structure of a CLI with Cobra
- Implementing flags with validation
- Configuration of nested subcommands
- Integration with configuration systems such as Viper

## Notes
- Preference for idiomatic solutions in Go
- Focus on clean and maintainable code
- Automated testing considerations
